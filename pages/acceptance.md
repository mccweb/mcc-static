Due to COVID-19 restrictions, our campus will remain closed through at least the end of the spring semester.  Students, however, will be able to register for classes and the enrollment team is here to assist.  Follow the steps below, and contact [ma-admissions@manchestercc.edu](mailto:ma-admissions@manchestercc.edu) with any questions along the way!

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply for financial aid

File the FAFSA by going to [www.fafsa.gov](http://www.fafsa.gov) (MCC’s school code is **001392**). Once the FAFSA is complete, you can follow the status of your financial aid through [myCommNet](http://my.commnet.edu "myCommNet"). Instructions for logging into your account are given below.

Additional documentation may be required for verification and processing, so we encourage you to apply as early as possible.  Visit [verification with Inceptia](/enrollment/financial-aid/verification/) for information related to verification, and contact the [Financial Aid office](mailto:finaid@manchestercc.edu) for all FAFSA inquiries.

### 2. Determine Course Placement

Due to the campus closure, assessment testing is currently unavailable.  In lieu of testing, we are placing students based on a combination of GPA and SAT/ACT Scores.

Please send all high school transcripts, SAT/ACT scores, or college transcripts to the Admissions Office via email at [ma-admissions@manchestercc.edu](mailto:ma-admissions@manchestercc.edu), via Naviance or via Parchment.

* **SAT/ACT Scores:** MCC reviews the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing Score, the breakdown of Reading and Writing Scores, and the Match Score.
* **High School Transcripts:** Students that have graduated within the last ten years can request transcripts from their high schools.
* **GED Transcripts:**  MCC reviews the Reasoning Through Language Arts and Mathematical Reasoning scores.
* **College Transcripts:** Official transcripts will be evaluated based on your declared major.  Electronic transcripts sent from the sending institution (not to the student and then forwarded) are preferred at this time.
* **If English is not the primary language you read and write:** We will assist you in selecting the appropriate English course to ensure your academic success. Send us your contact information and an English specialist will connect with you with further information.

### 3. Activate myCommNet

This portal will give you access to all of your student information.  When logging in for the first time, the NetID for a student ID (@01234567) will be "01234567@student.commnet.edu."  Please refer to your acceptance email for your unique Banner student ID. Your initial password will be:

* The first three letters of your birth month with the first letter capitalized (January = Jan)
* The ampersand (&) symbol
* The last four digits of your social security number
* The password will look similar to this: Jan&6789
* You will be required to change your password after initial login

### 4. Finalize all admissions paperwork

Proof of high school graduation and immunization to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) are required by the State of Connecticut of all students* that are enrolling into a degree program, attending full-time, and/or receiving financial aid. The Registrar's Office has provided an [Immunization Verification](/static/img/immunization-form.pdf) form. However, a record of vaccinations from a physician's office is also accepted. If you do not have access to your records, request a Titer (blood) test of all four diseases before getting any shots. High school graduation documents include a copy of your diploma, transcript, or GED. Students that have completed an associate degree or higher can use their college diploma or transcript in lieu of high school graduation documents.

Non-degree/non-matriculated students do not have to provide immunization records. However, financial aid is not available to students who are not matriculated in a degree program.

### 5. Register for classes

All new students and incoming transfer students need to complete the New Student Orientation course. The orientation will teach you how to navigate our college's procedures and tools, how to register for your classes, and how to connect with an MCC Advisor. All new students are enrolled in the New Student Orientation upon being accepted into Manchester Community College. To access the NSO portal, please set up your myCommNet account and proceed to Blackboard. Once inside your Blackboard Account you will see the New Student Orientation course. Should you wish to speak with an advisor, Step 4 of the NSO will allow you to request an appointment. 

Also, you will need to attend Cougar Class to learn about campus services and academic policies, which can be arranged by [emailing TJ Barber](mailto:tbarber@mcc.commnet.edu) or by calling him at 860-512-3282. Prior to registering, please make sure your placement documents and transcripts are on file with the Admissions Office. This will ensure that you receive the best advising experience. Without placement information and/or transfer credits in the system, the Advising team will be limited in how they can assist you!

### 6. Finalize all payment arrangements

Contact the Bursar's office at [geninfobursars@manchestercc.edu](mailto:geninfobursars@manchestercc.edu) or 860-512-3640 for more information regarding tuition and fees and acceptable forms of payment. MCC does reserve the right to drop students for non-payment, but this is not a guarantee. Financial aid and all required documents must be completed prior to paying for classes.  Visit myCommNet to check the status of your aid and any outstanding requirements. Students entering MCC as _New, First-Time_ college students are eligible to receive funding through the Pledge to Advance Connecticut (PACT) program. Students must have a FAFSA on file and register for at least 12 credits no later than July 15, 2020. Note that taking a summer course prior to the start of Fall 2020 will result in ineligibility to participate in PACT.

Continue to use the MCC website as a resource, as well. Information on deadlines, programs, classes and campus services and activities can be found here.

If you have any questions, contact the Admissions office at 860-512-3210, or simply reply to your acceptance email.

Once again, congratulations and welcome to Manchester Community College!
