## "Meet" with us!

We are still here! Just in a slightly different capacity. We are able to offer several options for information sessions for admissions and financial aid, Q&As to ask whatever questions you may have, a virtual Open House, as well as individual virtual meetings. See the links to register below. If you would like to meet virtually with someone one-on-one, please email [ma-admissions@manchestercc.edu](mailto:ma-admissions@manchestercc.edu) or call 860-512-3210.

## Getting Started

If you are ready to begin at MCC, your first step is to fill out an [online application](https://ct.elluciancrmrecruit.com/Apply).

## Costs and Facts

[Tuitions and Fees](https://www.ct.edu/admission/tuition) are low and the class sizes are small. The environment is student-centered and student life is very active.

We encourage students to submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid ([FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov)) if they are looking for financial assistance. Once submitted, students can access their MCC-specific financial aid package via the college's student information portal, [myCommNet](http://my.commnet.edu/).

Applicants are required to provide high school transcripts/GED or proof of college completion and immunizations showing immunity to MMR and Varicella (chicken pox).

Currently, all campus tours are on hold indefinitely.

## Admissions Office Hours

Due to current restrictions for COVID-19 and the Stage 3 Reopening Plan for Colleges and Universities, the Admissions Office is currently open by appointment only. Staff is on-site on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and other times by appointment.

## Campus Security

The [Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.1609:) (referred to as the Clery Act) is a federal law that requires institutions of higher education to disclose [crime statistics](/static/img/mcc-annual-security-report.pdf) for crimes occurring either on or in the immediate area of campus to new and prospective students."
