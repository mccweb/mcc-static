**Anthropology** is the scientific exploration of the origin, the behavior, and the physical, social, and cultural development of humans. It seeks answers to the illusive question of what it means to be human. Anthropology includes four broad fields of study: cultural anthropology, linguistics, physical anthropology and archaeology. 

**Psychology** is the science that deals with mental processes and behavior. The goal of understanding why we behave and feel as we do is a quest that continues to dominate scientific and social debate. Psychologists study questions that are inherently fascinating such as:

*   Why are some people shy and others outgoing and aggressive?
*   Why are some forms of deviant behaviors termed mental illness and others termed eccentric or even genius?
*   How are cognitive processes affected by racial, ethnic and gender-based prejudices?

Students can choose from these courses to satisfy their [general education knowledge areas](http://catalog.mcc.commnet.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=1158), the [Liberal Arts and Science associate in art](http://catalog.mcc.commnet.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=1669&returnto=1146) or the [Liberal Arts and Science associate in science](http://catalog.mcc.commnet.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=1670&returnto=1146) degree program requirements. For students who plan to transfer to complete the requirements for a bachelor of arts degree in psychology at one of the four Connecticut state universities or Charter Oak State College, enrolling in the college’s Psychology Studies Transfer Ticket degree pathway program is a good choice. By entering this program, students are able to start their course work at MCC and take advantage of its high quality instruction and more affordable community college tuition and fees. Upon completion of the [CSCU Pathway Transfer: Psychology Studies](http://www.ct.edu/files/tap/PSY.MCC.pdf) associate degree, students are guaranteed full junior status and can complete a bachelor's degree in their major without losing any credits or being required to take extra credits or incur additional expenses. Those who are interested in psychology or anthropology, or who are considering transferring to a college outside the CSCU system, should consider the [Liberal Arts and Science associate in arts degree program](http://catalog.mcc.commnet.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=1669&returnto=1146) or the [Liberal Arts and Science associate in science degree](http://catalog.mcc.commnet.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=1670&returnto=1146). Students who are thinking of transferring are encouraged to meet with their academic advisors to discuss their plans and how MCC courses transfer to other institutions.
