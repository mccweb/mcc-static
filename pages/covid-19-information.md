MCC continues to handle  most college business remotely via online means and by phone. However, effective immediately, students can set up appointments to come to campus on specific days and times to meet with Student Affairs staff.

Anyone coming onto campus for an appointment MUST wear a face mask/covering that covers their nose and mouth at all times and must practice social distancing.

Manchester Community College (MCC) is operating under special conditions as a precaution due to the coronavirus (COVID-19). Our campus buildings are closed to the general public until further notice and open to students only by appointment, to pick up purchases at the Bookstore, or to attend class. College staff are available remotely to help with applying for admission and financial aid, registering for courses, and providing information on additional services during regular business hours Monday through Friday.

Important Information for All Students Who Will be On-Campus for Classes or to Use College Services by Appointment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Students are required to wear face masks covering both the nose and mouth and campus-issued IDs at all times.
*   Social distancing is required while on campus.
*   The college has established designated entry points and exit points. All students with classes on ground. will need to enter campus through either the AST Center by the flagpoles or the SSC entrance by the Bookstore.
*   A sign-in/sign-out process for all students and staff at each entrance provides contact tracing should we need to provide that date to the Department of Public Health.
*   Some limitations on access to certain areas of campus.

### Additional safety measures include:

*   Room occupancy limits, moving of furniture and signage to enable social distancing.
*   Enhanced cleaning routines and sanitizing throughout the day according to CDC guidelines.
*   Hand sanitizer stations throughout campus.
*   Installation of plexiglass shields on desks and counters in labs and classrooms.

U-Pass
------

Continuing students – If you already have your MCC ID (printed this fall,) visit the Bursar’s Office (cashier windows in Lowe) Monday-Thursday between 9 a.m.-3 p.m.  
New students –The AST Information Desk where IDs are made is staffed currently 4 p.m.-7 p.m.; Tuesdays, 9 a.m.-Noon; and 1 p.m.-5 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays. We are working to staff Mondays and Tuesdays and will send an email when that happens. Until then, email [TJ Barber](mailto:tbarber@manchestercc.edu)  to set up an on-campus appointment to get your student ID if those hours don’t work for you. It takes approximately ten minutes at the most.

COVID-19 Exposure Tracing App
-----------------------------

COVID Alert CT sends an anonymous alert to your phone anytime your device has come into close proximity to a person with COVID-19 – all without sharing any personal information,

Once it’s turned on, your phone exchanges anonymous tokens – _not any personal information_ – with other devices (that have exposure notifications enabled) that you have close contact with via Bluetooth. _Close contact means being within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more in a 24-hour period._

If someone who was near you in the past 14 days tests positive for COVID-19, and you both have exposure notifications enabled – you’ll receive an alert. That alert only tells you that you were in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus – _it doesn’t tell you who._ The alert will give you information about next steps.   

If you test positive for COVID-19, the contact tracer you talk with will provide you with a code you can use to report to the app that you have tested positive for COVID-19. This is it is ensured that someone can’t submit a “joke” positive test without verification.

This is an important tool to support contact tracing efforts – not to replace them. It’s still critical that you have a conversation with a contact tracer. You can be sure – your personal information will be protected; it can’t be accessed by the Connecticut Department of Public Health, by Apple or by Google.  

More information about the app – including answers to common questions and download instructions – can be found at [ct.gov/covidalertct](http://ct.gov/covidalertct).  [Check out more about the app in this video from Google.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cz2Xzm6knM&feature=youtu.be)
