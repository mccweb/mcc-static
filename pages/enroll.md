<h3>Finish Your Coursework Faster With Accelerated Classes</h3>
<p>MCC offers 8- and 12-week accelerated courses during the Fall and Spring semesters, and three-week classes during the winter session in a large variety of subjects . Visit the <a href="https://ssb-prod.ec.commnet.edu/pls/x/bzskfcls.P_CrseSearch">course schedule</a> and choose the Winter semester or look in the "Title" and "Date" fields for these courses that are shorter in duration than the regular 15- week semester withinthe spring and fall offerings.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Paying for Your Classes</h3>
<p>Make sure you put together a solid plan for paying your tuition. If you haven't already, apply for financial aid and, please note, you have to apply each year.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible for financial aid, please remember that a portion of your tuition and fees  - if not all - are due at the time you register. A payment plan is available.</p>

<p>There may also be some scholarship money available. The library has put together an online <a href="http://libguides.manchestercc.edu/friendly.php?s=scholarships">guide</a> that might help.</p>

<p>Don't go through the process of designing your ideal schedule just to be dropped for non-payment. Plan early.</p>

<hr>

<h4>About Accelerated Courses</h4>
<p>While the number of weeks for each accelerated session is much shorter than those of the regular fall and spring semesters, students should be aware that each course contains the same number of class hours as the regular semester. As a result, the level of study is much more intensive and demanding of time. Students should consider this in planning their time and course selection.</p>
<h4>About Online Courses</h4>
<p>Although MCC’s online courses provide flexibility that allow students to access information and participate in course discussions anytime and anywhere via a computer and an Internet connection, these are not self-paced courses. Just as in any MCC course, students will have weekly deadlines for assignments, discussions and assessments. The content and expectations in an online course are the same as in an on-campus course at MCC. Online courses require a great deal of reading and writing, as well as strong computer literacy and time management skills.
