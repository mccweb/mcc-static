## Video Demonstration

This document was developed for faculty in the Connecticut Community Colleges as a quick guide to accompany the short demonstration video available on YouTube, entitled: **“Add Mechanical Fidelity Captions to Your Videos.”**

To access this video, please visit this our [Kaltura video playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmAFsK4a4rSbNVvNcOuomJoWT0NTy08kN)**.**

**_Note:_** _We strongly recommend that you watch the video first, so you can see a quick (six minute) overview of the entire process, which will provide some context for the navigation in My Media. Then the following step-by-step instructions will then walk you through the process._

## Scenario

An instructor wishes to add automatically generated captions to a video that is available to their students in Blackboard, using the Kaltura media tool. He can either add captions to a video that has already been uploaded into his “My Media” area in Kaltura, or a new video can be added to “My Media” and have captions added to it.

### How to Navigate to the Kaltura “My Media” repository from Blackboard’s My Institution page

**Important:** The only way to add or edit Mechanical Fidelity captions is by navigating to the “My Media” Kaltura repository from the My Institution page. You cannot add captions if you navigate to My Media from within a Blackboard course.

Although it is possible to view all _My Media_ content by navigating to it from within a Blackboard course shell, you cannot add or edit mechanical fidelity captions that way.

1. Log in and launch Blackboard.
2. In the CT Community Colleges, users land on the “My Institution” page.
3. Click on the “Kaltura My Media” subtab near the top left of the window.  
   ![Screenshot of Blackboard My Institution page with Kaltura My Media tab outlined with red border](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-1.jpg)
4. Click the “My Media” module link. This opens the “My Media” media repository for the user, where ALL of the videos that I have uploaded, for any course, are stored.

### How to Upload a Video to Kaltura “My Media” Mechanical

If the video you wish to add captions to has not previously been uploaded into My Media, follow these steps. If it has already been uploaded into _My Media_ (whether or not it has been linked to your courses), you can skip this step.

1. Click “Add New.”
2. Click “Media Upload.”  
   ![Screenshot showing the My Media page with the Add New button activated with a dropdown visible and the Media Upload option outlined with a red border](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-2.jpg)
3. Click “Choose a file to upload.”  
   ![Screenshot showing Upload Media heading and Choose a file to upload button](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-3.jpg)
4. Navigate to the video file you want to add captions to, select it, and open it.
   1. Be sure the name you give the video matches the title referenced in your Syllabus or elsewhere in your course.
5. Scroll down the page and click “Save.”
6. Then click “Go to My Media” to return to the _My Media_ tool.  
   ![Screenshot showing the bottom of the My Media page with two radio button options, a Save button, a Go To Media button and a Go To My Media button outlined with a red border](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-4.jpg)

### How to Request Mechanical Fidelity Captions for a Video

1. When you go into the **My Media** tool, you will be looking at your list of videos. From the list of videos, click the blue title link of the video you want to add captions to.  
   ![Screenshot of the My Media tool page showing the title of a video next to the video's thumbnail. The title is outlined with a red border.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-5.jpg)
2. Click the “Actions” button, and select “Order Captions.”  
   ![Screenshot of a video page with the Actions button activated, which shows a dropdown with various options. The Order Captions option in the list is outlined with a red border.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-6.jpg)
3. The only option you will see here is “Mechanical (70 to 80% accuracy)”. Click “Order Captions.”  
   ![Screenshot showing a select list with the label Fidelity. One option is available and selected. The Order Captions button is outlined with a red border.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-7.jpg)
4. A confirmation screen will display. Click “OK.”  
   ![Screenshot of confirmation message after ordering captions. The text in the confirmation is "Thank You! Your caption request has been received. Captions will be automatically uploaded to your video upon completion."](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-8.jpg)
5. You will see information about the caption order status. As the process is working, you will first see a Status saying it is _Authorizing_, then _Processing_, and eventually _Complete_.

**Note:** It can take some time for captions to process—depending upon the length of the video. So you may wish to leave “My Media” to do some other work. Then you can navigate back to “My Media” later to continue review and editing the captions once processing is complete.

### How to Review and Edit Mechanical Fidelity Captions

If you left “My Media” to do other work, or left Blackboard completely, follow the steps in the “**How to Navigate to the Kaltura “My Media” repository from Blackboard’s My Institution page”** section of this document to navigate back to the My Media tool. _(Remember - you MUST navigate to My Media from the My Institution page, not from within a Bb course!)_

1. From the **My Media** tool (where your videos are listed), click on the video title, then the “Actions” button. Select “View Caption Requests.”  
   ![Screenshot of a video detail page with the Actions button activated and the resulting dropdown showing multiple options. The View Caption Requests button is outlined with a red border.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-10.jpg)
2. Assuming the Status is shown as COMPLETE, the next step is to Edit the captions.  
   ![Screenshot showing a Caption Request where the Status shows a COMPLETE header and an Edit button sits below that header.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-11.jpg)
   1. Please note that, depending upon your web browser and the local security settings on your computer, you may see a warning message or pop-up blocker message. You can approve these by clicking “Continue” or allowing the pop-up to display from the website.
3. In the Editing window, you can make the changes to your captions. Note the Hotkeys and Sound Tag shortcuts shown in the panel at right, as this may be helpful in some videos.  
   ![Screenshot of the caption editing tool view. The captions provided by Kaltura appear on the left side of the screen. The video itself, along with the video player controls and a section to edit the captions is in the middle of the page. Keyboard shortcuts, Tag shortcuts and information about the version of the Kaltura tool are on the right side of the page.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-12.jpg)
4. **Save** and **Approve** buttons:
   1. Clicking **Save** saves the edits that have been done without updating the captions that display on the video.
   2. Click **Approve** when you are all done and wish to update the captions that display to viewers on the video.
5. A dialog box displays showing the job was approved.  
   ![Screenshot of the dialog box that appears after you approve your changes to the caption. It reads "Job Approved. Your job has been approved. Please close this browser tab or window"](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-13.jpg)
6. Close the browser tab or window in which the Editor appears to return to the **My Media** tab or window so you can view your video with the captions displayed.
   1. If you need to do additional editing:
      1. In **My Media**, click the “Actions” button under the displayed video.
      2. Click “Caption Requests”
      3. Click “Edit”
      4. This will bring once again open the editing window in a new tab or window.
7. **If you have not already done so, you can now go into your Blackboard course shell and determine where in the course you wish to make the video available**, for example, in the Media Gallery tool, or as Kaltura Media, or as a Mashup in an announcement, item, discussion, etc.

## How Students Can Search for Terms in Captions

Students will have the ability to search for key words or phrases in your video’s automatically-generated captions if you have made the Kaltura “Media Gallery” available to students in your course.

1. Add Media Gallery tool to the course menu
   1. Click “Add Menu button” + sign above menu
   2. Select “Add Tool Link”
   3. In the _Name_ field type “Media Gallery” and from the _Type_ dropdown select “Media Gallery.”
   4. Click “Available to Users” and Submit.
   5. Drag the new menu button from the bottom of the menu to the location where you want it to appear.
2. Then add the video with the captions into the Media Gallery.
3. Students simply click on the video they want to watch in the Media Gallery.
4. If they wish to search for a word or phrase, they type it into the _Search_ field and click the Search button.
5. Links will appear below just below the search box with the matching text. A student clicks the link to go to the selected point in the video.
