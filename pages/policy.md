**Important:** Policy last updated on October 5, 2020.

## Background and Rationale

The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (“CSCU”) provides equal opportunity to its educational and administrative services, programs and activities in accordance with federal and state law. CSCU is committed to ensuring equal access to information, programs, and activities through its information technologies, web pages, web-based applications, operating system-based applications, digital instructional content, services, and resources (“electronic information and technology” or “EIT”). Therefore, digital information, websites, technology, coursework, and email need to be accessible by all in an understandable way. This is in accordance with federal and state laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the Amendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 508 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act as amended and the State of Connecticut’s Universal Website Accessibility Policy for state websites.

## Purpose of the Policy

The purpose of the CSCU Accessibility Policy for EIT (“CSCU Accessibility Policy” or “Policy”) is to establish standards for the accessibility of EIT considered necessary to ensure compliance with applicable local, state and federal regulations and laws. CSCU is committed to designing, developing, and procuring EIT that is accessible to all individuals with disabilities.

## Implementation of the Policy

CSCU Institutions are required to develop local procedures to implement, monitor and ensure compliance to the established standards in this Policy.

## Enforcement of the Policy

Enforcement of this Policy is the responsibility of institutional and system leadership.

## Compliance of the Policy

All CSCU administrators, faculty, staff, and students are responsible for fulfilling the requirements of the Policy.

Non-compliance may result in barriers that impact students’ ability to succeed within our institutions as well as faculty or staff members’ ability to successfully complete their duties. If those actions are deemed in violation of applicable laws, the responsible individual, institution, or system may be at risk for litigation or loss of federal funding.

## Policy Statement

This Policy extends to the electronic information and technologies used in administrative services and in and out of the classroom, and applies to their procurement, design, development, implementation, ongoing maintenance and use. Providing equal and effective electronic information and technology access is the responsibility of all CSCU administrators, faculty, staff and students.

_The review of this policy will occur biennially._

## Definitions

"Accessible” means that individuals with disabilities are able to independently acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services within the same timeframe as individuals without disabilities, with substantially equivalent ease of use.

“Archived EIT” refers to EIT developed, maintained, procured, materially revised, or hosted by the institution before this Policy’s effective date and is retained by the institution solely for informational or regulatory purposes.

“CSCU” or “CSCU institution(s)” includes the CSCU System Office, the four constituent Connecticut State Universities, Charter Oak State College, and twelve Connecticut State Community Colleges.

“Disability” means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.

“Electronic information and technology" or "EIT" includes information technology and any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used in the creation, conversion, or duplication of data or information. The term includes, but is not limited to, the internet and intranet websites, content delivered in digital form; including, but not limited to, word processing documents, PDFs, presentations, publications, and spreadsheets which are scanned, uploaded, posted, or otherwise published or distributed electronically, electronic books and electronic book reading systems, search engines and databases, learning management systems, classroom technology and multimedia, and personal response systems ("clickers"). It also includes any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, creation, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. This term includes telecommunication products (such as telephones), information kiosks, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) transaction machines, computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources. In cases where multiple telecommunication devices exist within the same location (and it is not reasonable to ensure all devices meet Policy standards), at least one telecommunication device must be accessible. Experimental electronic information and technology in a production environment are not exempt from this Policy.

“Equally effective” means that the alternative format or medium communicates the same information in as timely a fashion as does the original format or medium.

“Legacy EIT” refers to EIT developed, maintained, procured, materially revised, or hosted by the institution before this Policy’s effective date and that remains in active use. Legacy EIT must be updated to be in compliance with the applicable standards and guidelines described in the Procedures section of this Policy, or the content must otherwise be made available in an equally effective accessible format and in a timely manner to any individual requesting access. The unit responsible for its maintenance must make it compliant with the applicable standards or provide an equally effective accommodation.

Each college, department, program, or unit must establish its own priorities and timetables for updating legacy EIT; or plan for its transition to archival status or its removal. Priority must be given to creating accessible EIT for core institutional information such as course work, registration, advising, admission, and catalogs; and student, faculty, and staff information.

“New EIT” refers to EIT developed, maintained, procured, materially revised, or hosted by the institution after this Policy’s effective date.

## Responsible Persons

CSCU Executive Leadership has overall responsibility for the implementation of this Policy. CSCU faculty, staff, and administrators all share in the CSCU responsibility for accessible EIT. Each shall execute this Policy and undertake reasonable efforts to bring EIT developed, maintained, revised, procured, or hosted within their purview into compliance with applicable state and federal law and the technical standards specified above as well as outlined within the procedures section. Creators of any digital content are responsible for meeting accessibility standards.

## Technical Standards

CSCU’s technical standards for measuring accessibility are those published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). CSCU will endeavor to follow the most current published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag)), however, the minimum technical standards are (a) [WCAG 2.1 Level AA for Web-based EIT](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and (b) [Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/) ([WCAG2ICT](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/)). These technical standards may be updated as needed to remain current with the most recent WCAG guidelines or compliant with applicable law. CSCU will also look for guidance to applicable provisions of the United States Access Board’s Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as well as State of Connecticut’s Universal Website Accessibility Policy for State Websites.

#### 8. Standards: Exceptions

#### 8.1 Scope

The CSCU Accessibility Policy requires that all digital information and digital services developed, acquired, managed, or otherwise meet the CSCU accessibility standards. **If an exception is required, the college or university must document the process by which the college or university will ensure to provide effective access, with substantially equivalent ease of use, to digital information and digital services for eligible individuals in a timely manner.**

#### 8.2 Required Information

Exception requests must contain the following elements in order to be considered:

##### _8.2.1 Requesting Unit Contacts_

Contact information for the below parties:

* The individual making the request
* The requesting unit
* The staff responsible for oversight and administration of the Equally Effective Access Accommodation Plan (EEAP)

##### _8.2.2 Rationale_

The requesting unit must document how this request fits into one or more of the following categories:

* Compliance is not technically possible or feasible given current technology
* The digital information or digital service is used by a limited audience, when the audience is known, and whose needs can be accounted for in advance
* For third party, vendor delivered products, no accessible alternative for the digital information or digital service exists
* The EIT that best meets the college or university needs is not the most accessible option, when other more accessible options have been considered
* Making the Digital Information or Digital Service accessible would require extraordinary measures that constitute an undue burden to the university

**Note:** For the purposes of determining if an undue burden exists, CSCU is considered to be a single entity, and thus a burden would be analyzed according to the impact to the system as a whole and not to the unit requesting the exception.

##### _8.2.3 Equally Effective Access Accommodation Plan (EEAAP)_

This plan should address how access barriers in the digital information or digital service will be mitigated, and any benefits or opportunities afforded by the digital information or digital service will be provided, in a timely manner for eligible individuals who are unable to effectively use or interact with the digital information or digital service.

Depending on the nature of the digital information or digital service, examples of an EEAAP might include:

* Providing an alternative that effectively provides an equivalent result, e.g. an alternative software that performs the same or similar function.
* Providing assistance to the eligible individual either in-person or over the phone.
* Providing the digital information in a format that meets our accessibility standards.

This plan should take into account the critical nature and timeliness of the digital information or digital service and address a method to ensure that the eligible individual can access the accommodation without any adverse consequences resulting from the need for the accommodation. For example, any deadlines imposed by the digital information or digital service that are not met due to the use of an accommodation must be waived, and the requesting unit must have a plan to ensure this occurs.

Timeliness should be considered in light of the nature of the digital information or digital service. The accommodation plan should also address the timeline for delivering the accommodation, and the process by which any benefits or opportunities afforded by the digital information or digital service will be provided to the eligible individual.

##### _8.2.4 Communication Plan_

The requesting unit must document a plan to ensure that eligible individuals are made aware of the availability of the EEAAP, and the steps they must take to request access, if applicable. These communications should be readily accessible in the same places that any other general communication regarding access to the digital information or digital service are present.

##### _8.2.5 Compliance Plan_

Requesting units should document their plan to bring the digital information into compliance with our accessibility standards.

These plans might include:

* Contract language obligating the vendor of third-party digital information or digital services to bring their software or content into compliance within a period of time.
* For internally developed digital information or digital services, a timeline for making them accessible and compliant with CSCU accessibility standards.
* Detailed collaboration with the vendor to bring their digital information or digital service into compliance.
* Advocacy for accessibility by contributing to open source products and services.

The requesting unit must, if the digital information or digital service is not internally developed, have a compliance plan if the third party fails to make their digital information or digital service accessible.

Examples include:

* Contract termination
* Financial penalties
* Selection of an alternative product
* Development of accessible front end
* Replacement with internally developed alternative
* Contributing to an open source product or service’s accessibility features

##### _8.2.6 Accessible Alternative Justification_

The requesting unit must document if their purchasing process evaluated other alternatives that were more accessible. If so, the requesting unit must explain what accessibility reasons necessitate the selection of the less accessible option. If accessible alternatives did not exist at time of use or purchase, the unit must document their plan to ensure that a search for a more accessible alternative is conducted when the contract or exception expires.
