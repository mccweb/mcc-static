## Registering for Classes

There are four academic registration periods: Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer.

**Fall and Spring:** General fund courses run for 16 weeks in a semester format. Credit extension courses run for eight weeks in two blocks: Session I during the first eight weeks of the semester and Session II runs the second eight weeks of the semester. There is also a 12-week accelerated session offered during both the fall and spring.

**Winter:** Accelerated credit extension courses run for three weeks in between the fall and spring semesters.

**Summer:** Accelerated credit extension courses run for three, six and eight weeks with start dates in May, June and July.

Registration times vary depending on the student and the semester. For a detailed schedule, please refer to the [academic calendar](https://www.ct.edu/academics/calendar).

New students can register for classes once they have attended New Student Orientation. Transfer students are not required to meet with an advisor for program and/or course selection but may schedule a meeting by calling Advising and Counseling Services at 860-512-3320.

Students interested in transferring credits to MCC should have their prior college transcript evaluated in the Admissions office before meeting with an advisor. Please bring the preliminary evaluation with you to your advising meeting. Students who are not pursuing a degree or certificate at MCC, plan to register for 11 credits or fewer, have an assessment test exemption, and/or meet all the requirements for testing and immunizations can register online or in person.

## Add/Drop

Add/drop can be done online through myCommNet, normally through the first week of classes for the full semester course.  For accelerated classes that meet less than the full 15 week semester, add/drop ends before the classes begin. You can read more about the withdrawal policy on the [withdrawal/refund page](/enrollment/registrar/withdrawal-and-refund-policies/)

## Transcripts

Information for requesting college transcripts can be found on the [Transcript Request page](/transcripts/).
