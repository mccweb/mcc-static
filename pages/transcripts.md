Manchester Community College now offers the ability to obtain official transcripts in an electronic format (eTranscript). Current and former students can request official eTranscripts to be sent to other educational institutions, potential employers, or any other appropriate entities.

## Current and Recent Students

Students who have been issued a NetID and password should [log in to myCommNet](http://my.commnet.edu/), navigate to Banner Self-Service, Student Records, Transcripts, and click on the Request an Official eTranscript link. If you do not remember your NetID or password, please use the online self-help tools to obtain your NetID or reset your NetID password.

## Former Students

Students who have not been issued a NetID, please visit [eTranscripts](https://exchange.parchment.com/send/adds/index.php?main_page=login&s_id=8hWaLmhh51QLXeOs) to submit an official eTranscript request. Please ensure that your last name, first name, date of birth and last four digits of your SSN are entered correctly so that your request can be processed in a timely manner.
