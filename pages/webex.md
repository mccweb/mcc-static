 8. WebEx will open a new window/tab to play your recording
 9. Depending on the length of the recording, WebEx may need 5-10 minutes of processing time for every 1 minute of recording. You may see a similar message as below if captioning is still processing. The text in the message is "We are still preparing the transcript for your meeting. When it's available, it will appear here. Note: After your recording is ready, it may take up to approximately twice the duration of your meeting to prepare the transcript."
