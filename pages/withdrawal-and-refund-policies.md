It is the responsibility of each student to know and comply with the withdrawal policies and deadlines. Ignorance of policies or deadlines cannot be used as justification for a refund.

Once the semester starts, students are advised to consult with their academic advisor before making changes, or contact Advising and Counseling Services. Students who register after the drop for non-payment deadline will not be dropped for non-payment. Students will incur a financial obligation to the college if payment is not received or if they do not withdraw prior to the course withdrawal/refund deadline.

### Additional Refund Policies for General Fund and Credit Extension Courses

Tuition and fees post to a student’s account automatically when the student registers for a course. It is the student’s responsibility to formally drop a course. If the college cancels a course, the student will automatically be granted 100 percent adjustment of associated charges except the application fee. Tuition cannot be transferred to other semesters. Other non-refundable fees include:

*   Application Fee
*   Installment Plan
*   Late Payment
*   Transportation Fee (Fall and Spring Semesters)

It is also important to note:

*   Failure to attend a class does not relieve the student of financial responsibility for a course.
*   Refund policies assume that all charges have been paid in full prior to drop/withdrawal. In some cases, an account adjustment may not entitle a student to an actual refund.
*   Students are required to officially drop class(es) by the official deadline published each semester in the _Enrollment_ Guide for fall and spring classes, and in the _Summer Session and Winter Intersession Catalogs_. If you do not drop a course within the allowable drop period, you are still obligated to pay for the course, whether or not you attend; the college does not automatically drop students from courses because they do not attend.
*   Deadlines for credit extension sessions are based on the start date of courses and are adjusted appropriately.
*   Refund/returns of Title IV funds are made in accordance with applicable federal rules and regulations that take precedence over college refund policies.
*   Students receiving financial aid must consult with the Financial Aid office before dropping or withdrawing

* Courses that a student drops will be removed from the student’s schedule and will not appear on his/her transcript.
